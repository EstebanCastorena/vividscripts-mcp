"""OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata endpoint (RFC 9728, KAN-48).

RFC 9728 lets MCP clients (Claude Code) auto-discover the authorization
servers they should authenticate against. The flow:

1. Client hits ``/mcp`` without a Bearer token.
2. Server returns ``401`` with ``WWW-Authenticate: Bearer
   resource_metadata="https://<host>/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource"``.
3. Client fetches that URL → gets back the JSON document this module serves.
4. Client uses the ``authorization_servers`` field to discover OAuth endpoints
   (DCR, authorize, token) and complete the auth dance.

Phase 1 ships placeholder issuer + AS URLs. Production wiring (Cognito issuer,
real deployment host) lands in Phase 3.

    """Default-deny Bearer gate for the MCP server (KAN-94, audit findings #1 + #2).

    Posture is **default-deny**: every HTTP request is gated unless its
    path is on the explicit allow-list (:data:`_PUBLIC_EXACT_PATHS` /
    :data:`_PUBLIC_PATH_PREFIXES`). The previous gate matched only
    ``/mcp`` and ``/mcp/...`` and let everything else through, so
    ``/MCP``, dot-segments, or any future route the inner FastMCP app
    grows (legacy ``/sse``/``/messages`` transports, etc.) bypassed
    auth entirely. Default-deny + path normalization closes that whole
    class of bypass.

    Two enforcement layers run on every gated path:

    1. **Presence.** Any request without ``Authorization: Bearer <...>``
       earns a 401 whose ``WWW-Authenticate`` header points clients at
       the PRM document (RFC 6750 § 3 + RFC 9728 § 5.1).
    2. **Validity** (when a ``validator`` is configured — KAN-52). The
       Bearer token is cryptographically verified (signature, audience,
       issuer, ``token_use``, expiry). On rejection, the response is a
       401 with ``error="invalid_token"`` in the ``WWW-Authenticate``
       header per RFC 6750 § 3.1.

    Validated user claims are bound to the auth-context ``ContextVar``
    so MCP tool handlers can read the authenticated user via
    :func:`vividscripts_mcp.oauth.context.require_user_claims`. The
    ``contextvars.Token`` is captured before the downstream call and
    reset in a ``try/finally`` so the bind is unwound on **every** code
    path — success, early return, or downstream exception. Without the
    reset the bind persists in the caller's context and a stale
    identity leaks into the next code path that reads it (audit
    finding #1).

    Claims are also stashed on the ASGI scope under
    ``scope["state"]["bearer_claims"]`` for any middleware/handler that
    prefers the scope contract over the contextvar.
